# 1. Introduction

The defining economic unit of the 2020s is not the corporation but the networked individual—the "Micro-Entity." This category includes independent software vendors (ISVs), specialized content creators, and single-proprietor consultants who generate significant revenue streams without traditional organizational structures.

However, the growth of the Micro-Entity is strictly bounded by the "Linear Scaling Limit." To increase output, the individual must currently either:
1.  Increase personal labor hours (capped by biological limits).
2.  Hire employees (introducing management friction).

This creates a paradox: The mechanism designed to solve the labor shortage (hiring) introduces a management tax that consumes the time saved. This "Friction Trap" prevents Micro-Entities from competing with institutional incumbents.

This paper proposes that the solution is not "better hiring" but "friction deletion." By introducing an algorithmic intermediation layer—an "Operating System for Virtual Work"—we can decouple the execution of a task from the identity of the worker, thereby allowing labor to be consumed as a utility rather than a relationship.
