# 1. Introduction

In 2026, the most important business unit is not the big company. It is the **Micro-Entity**. This is one person (a "solopreneur") who uses the internet to make a lot of money without having any employees.

### The Scaling Problem
Even though these people are successful, they hit a wall. To grow their business, they have two choices:
1.  **Work more hours**: But a human only has 24 hours in a day.
2.  **Hire employees**: But hiring people is slow and expensive.

This is the **"Friction Trap."** In 1937, the economist **Ronald Coase** explained that companies exist because it is expensive to find, hire, and manage outside workers. These are "Transaction Costs." For a Micro-Entity, these costs are too high. If you spend all day managing a freelancer, you have no time to grow your own business.

### The Solution: Deleting Friction
We believe the answer is not hiring "better" people. The answer is **deleting the friction** by using a specialized computer system. 

By building an "Operating System for Virtual Work," Nimmit disconnects the work from the person. We treat memory (how to do the work) as data. This allows work to be done like a utility—just like turning on a light switch. You don't need a relationship with the power plant to get electricity; you just need a standard plug. Nimmit is that plug for high-level work.
