# 4. Economic Impact: Reliability over Cost

Most companies outsource work to other countries just to save money. This is called "Cost Arbitrage." The problem is that cheap work is often low quality. The client saves money but loses time fixing mistakes.

Nimmit focuses on **Reliability Arbitrage**. Because of the **Context Cloud**, we provide high-quality results every single time.

### 4.1 The Value Surplus
By using AI to delete waste, we create a "Value Surplus." This means there is extra value for everyone.
- **For the Client**: You get "Agency Quality" (very high) at "Freelancer Prices" (very low). Best of all, you spend zero time managing the worker.
- **For the Worker**: Because the Orchestrator is 10x faster with AI, Nimmit can pay them 3x more than the local average wage. 

This is a win-win. We don't compete on being the "cheapest." We compete on being the most **reliable**.

### 4.2 Conclusion: The Future of Work
The future of work is not "Human vs. AI." It is "Human + AI." 

By building a system that handles the memory and the boring tasks, we allow people to focus on what they are best at: **Judgment**. This shift from "hiring people" to "buying outcomes" is the next step for the global economy. Nimmit is the platform that makes this possible.
