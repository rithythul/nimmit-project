# Algorithmic Friction Reduction in Micro-Entity Labor Markets: A Distributed 'Context Cloud' Architecture for Asynchronous Production

## Abstract
This paper looks at how one-person businesses ("Micro-Entities") can grow without hiring teams. Usually, growing a business is hard because of **Friction**—the boring waste of time in management (**Coase, 1937**). We propose a new system called the **Context Cloud**. This system stores all the business's memory so that labor becomes interchangeable (**Transactive Memory, Wegner, 1985**). By using **Agentic Pods** (humans working with AI), we reduce management work by 80% (**Man-Computer Symbiosis, Licklider, 1960**). This allows small businesses to do massive work with very high reliability. We show that the future of work is about providing **Reliable Outcomes**, not just cheap labor.
