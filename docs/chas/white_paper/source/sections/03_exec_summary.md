# Executive Summary

The digital labor market is currently inefficient due to the high cognitive cost of management. For the emerging class of "Micro-Entities" (solopreneurs and creators generating high revenue with zero employees), the bottleneck is delegating complex tasks without losing quality or spending excessive time on supervision.

This paper outlines an architectural solution: The **Context Cloud**.

Unlike traditional delegation, where context (preferences, style, history) resides in the mind of a specific employee, the Context Cloud stores this data in a centralized vector database. This allows the Platform to act as the "Employer of Record" for the *memory*, effectively making the human labor fungible. A worker can leave, and a new worker can step in immediately, accessing the same Context Cloud to deliver consistent results.

We define this model as **Agentic Orchestration**. It combines:
1.  **AI Agents**: To handle the 80% of tasks defined as "Friction" (file sorting, initial formatting, data structure).
2.  **Human Orchestrators**: To handle the 20% of tasks defined as "Judgment" (quality assurance, emotional resonance, final polish).

This architecture demonstrates that when friction is removed via algorithmic routing, the cost of high-quality creative output drops precipitously, while the wages for the Orchestrators (specifically in developing markets like Cambodia) can rise above local baselines. This creates a "value surplus" shared by the client (infinite capacity) and the worker (higher income for higher-level work).
