# Executive Summary

The digital world is full of wasted time. We call this **Friction**. 

For "Micro-Entities" (one-person businesses with high revenue), the biggest problem is not money—it is the time spent managing people. In economics, this is called **Transaction Costs (Coase, 1937)**. If it takes you two hours to explain a task that takes two hours to do, you have not saved any time. This is the "Friction Trap."

This paper explains a new solution: **The Context Cloud**.

### 1. The Context Cloud
In a normal job, when a worker leaves, they take their knowledge with them. This is "Institutional Forgetting." In Nimmit, all knowledge (styles, rules, and history) is stored in a computer system called a **Vector Database**. This is based on the idea of **Transactive Memory (Wegner, 1985)**—a group brain that remembers everything. 

This means that any worker can start working for a client immediately. The computer gives them the "memory" they need. 

### 2. Agentic Orchestration
We use a team model called the **Agentic Pod**. This is based on **Man-Computer Symbiosis (Licklider, 1960)**.
- **AI Agents**: These handle the boring "Friction" (80% of the work).
- **Human Orchestrators**: They handle the important "Judgment" (20% of the work).

### 3. The Result: Reliability Arbitrage
Most companies try to save money by hiring cheap labor. We focus on **Reliability**. By using AI to delete waste, we provide high-quality work every time. This creates a "Value Surplus" where the client saves time and the worker in Cambodia earns higher wages for high-level thinking.
