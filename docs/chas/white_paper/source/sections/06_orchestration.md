# 3. Agentic Orchestration: The 'Pod' Model

A computer alone cannot do high-quality creative work. It lacks "taste." However, a human alone is often slow and forgets small details. The solution is the **Agentic Pod**.

This model is a modern version of **Man-Computer Symbiosis (Licklider, 1960)**. Licklider predicted that humans and computers would one day work together so closely that they would act as one single team.

### 3.1 The 80/20 Rule of Labor
We divide all work into two types:
1.  **Friction (80%)**: Boring tasks like naming files, fixing formats, and checking data.
2.  **Judgment (20%)**: Important tasks like choosing the best style, making people feel emotion, and the final quality check.

The **Agentic Pod** gives the **Friction** to the AI and the **Judgment** to the human **Orchestrator**.

### 3.2 The Orchestrator: Not a Servant, but a Pilot
An Orchestrator in Phnom Penh does not do the boring typing. They "pilot" many AI tools at once. 

Because the AI does 80% of the work, one Orchestrator can do the work of 10 people. They spend their time thinking and making sure the work is high-quality, not fighting with software.

### 3.3 The "Interface of Stability"
For the client, it doesn't matter which human is working on their job. They talk to the Nimmit platform (the API). The platform makes sure the results are identical every time, regardless of which worker is in the Pod. This is how we make labor "interchangeable" while keeping quality high.
