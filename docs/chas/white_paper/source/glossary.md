# Nimmit Glossary: A Simple Guide to the Future of Work

This glossary defines the key words used in the Nimmit White Paper. We use simple English so that everyone can understand.

## 1. Core Concepts

### **Context Cloud**
*   **Simple Meaning**: A "group brain" in the computer that remembers how a client likes their work done.
*   **Why it matters**: It means if a worker leaves, the next worker doesn't have to ask the client the same questions again. The computer already knows the answer.
*   **Academic Anchor**: **Transactive Memory System (Wegner, 1985)**. In nature, people remember who has which skills. In Nimmit, the "Cloud" remembers for the whole team.

### **Friction**
*   **Simple Meaning**: "Wasted effort" or "annoying steps."
*   **Examples**: Searching for files, fixing simple typos, or waiting for an email reply.
*   **Why it matters**: 80% of work time is often wasted on these boring tasks. Nimmit deletes this "friction" using AI.
*   **Academic Anchor**: **Transaction Costs (Coase, 1937)**. The "hidden costs" of doing business.

### **Agentic Pod**
*   **Simple Meaning**: A small, fast team of **AI Tools** working with a **Human Expert**.
*   **Why it matters**: AI does the boring work (80%), and the human does the important thinking (20%).
*   **Academic Anchor**: **Man-Computer Symbiosis (Licklider, 1960)**. The idea that humans and computers work better together as a single team.

### **Management Tax**
*   **Simple Meaning**: The time you lose when you have to explain things to an employee.
*   **Why it matters**: If it takes you 2 hours to explain a 2-hour task, you haven't saved any time. This is why many "Micro-Entities" stay small.

## 2. The Players

### **Micro-Entity**
*   **Simple Meaning**: A "One-Person Business" that makes a lot of money and has zero employees.
*   **Role**: These are the clients of Nimmit.

### **Orchestrator**
*   **Simple Meaning**: A high-skill worker who "drives" the AI tools.
*   **Role**: They don't do the typing; they do the checking and the choosing.

### **Fungible Labor**
*   **Simple Meaning**: "Interchangeable workers."
*   **Why it matters**: Because the **Context Cloud** holds the memory, any worker can do a great job for any client. The client trusts the **Platform**, not just a single person.

## 3. The Big Result

### **Outcome Reliability**
*   **Simple Meaning**: Getting the same high-quality result every single time.
*   **Comparison**: Most outsourcing is about **Cost** (being cheap). Nimmit is about **Reliability** (being perfect).

### **Reliability Arbitrage**
*   **Simple Meaning**: A smart way to make money by providing "Agency Quality" at "Freelancer Prices" because the AI removes the waste.
