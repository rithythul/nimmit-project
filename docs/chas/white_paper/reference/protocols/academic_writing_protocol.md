# Academic and Technical Publication Standards
*Master Quality Directive for All Internal and External Documents*

To ensure excellence and eliminate stylistic failures, all writing must follow these hard-coded rules.

## 1. Linguistic Precision (The Engineer's Stance)
*   **Zero-Tolerance Word List**: NEVER use these words. Use the provided alternatives.
    *   **Utilize**: Use "use" or "employ." (4 syllables vs. 1).
    *   **Proposed / Potential / Suggests**: State the mechanical relationship directly. "The mandate requires..." not "The proposed mandate suggests..."
    *   **Persistence / Persist**: Use "existence" or "failure." (Prefer single-syllable when possible).
    *   **Foster / Facilitate / Leverage / Robust / Nuance**: Describe the mechanical action instead.
    *   **In conclusion / Ultimately / Crucial to note**: Omit. Use a direct, impactful statement.
    *   **Wicked / Greedy / Moralistic Adjectives**: Strip all moral judgment. Use "fiscal failure" or "systemic exclusion."
*   **Simple English**: Prefer short, direct words over multi-syllabic academic "fluff." Apply the "One-Syllable Test" to connective tissue and headers.
*   **Plain-English Definitions**: All novel technical terms (DAO, Smart Contract) must be defined using everyday analogies (e.g., "Digital Cooperative," "Automated Agreement") for an uninformed reader.
*   **No Refutational Phrasing**: Avoid "not just," "rather than," or "merely." State what a thing *is* directly. Avoid defining by contrast.

## 2. Punctuation and Structure (The Anti-Crutch Mandate)
*   **No Em-dashes (— or --)**: Em-dashes are a structural failure. Never use them to glue fractured thoughts. 
    *   **Remedy**: Rebuild the sentence. Use a period, a colon, or a coordinating conjunction.
*   **No mid-paragraph bolding**: Bold is for headers and technical lists only.
*   **No "Quotes" for Emphasis**: Never put a term in quotes unless it is a literal transcription from a source.
*   **Sentence Cap**: 25 words maximum. If a thought is complex, atomize it into discrete steps.

## 3. Conceptual Extrapolation (The "No Verbatim" Rule)
*   **No Verbatim Examples**: Never repeat operator-provided anecdotes, examples, or metaphors in the final text.
*   **Translation**: Extrapolate collaboration inputs into objective academic axioms. 
    *   *Example*: Transform "searching for water" into "survival logistics" or "manual resource procurement."
*   **Systemic Universalization**: Translate personal experience into universal laws of urban governance and biology.

## 4. Technical Logistics (The "How" Mandate)
*   **No Vague Abstractions**: Any proposal must include the actual "How, When, Where, Who, What, Why, How Much, How Many, How Long, How Often."
*   **Hardware First**: Define the physical reality (materials, square footage, specific utility inserts) before the social goal.
*   **Operational Detail**: Specify the procurement cycle (e.g., 90-day motel conversion) and the location (e.g., urban infill in transit corridors).

## 5. Domain-Specific Bridges (Sensitivity & Polarization)
For topics involving **High Emotional Voltage** (e.g., poverty, homelessness, polarization) or **High Epistemic Uncertainty**, the writer must integrate logic from `specs/workflows/draft_bridged_article.md`:
*   **Linguistic Neutrality**: Strictly avoid tribal identity markers and moral superiority signals. Use "Shared Observation" (direct physiological/historical patterns) over "Expert Prediction."
*   **Evidence Hierarchy**: Prioritize direct observation and verified historical patterns (Tier 1) over government surveys or media reports (Tier 3).
*   **Tone Alignment**: Ensure the document provides a "Refuge of Clarity" rather than a "Weapon of Advocacy."

## 6. Workflow Hierarchy
*   **academic_writing_protocol.md**: The master source for **Tone, Style, and Language**. 
*   **ssrn_production_protocol.md**: Secondary source for **LaTeX/SSRN Structure, Typesetting, and Build Pipeline**.
*   **draft_bridged_article.md**: Required supplement for **Sensitive or Polarizing Subjects**.

*Note: In cases of conflict, academic_writing_protocol.md takes precedence for all linguistic and stylistic choices.*
