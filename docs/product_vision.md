# Product Vision: The Digital Command Center

**The Concept:**
If Nimmit is a "System" in the physical world, the App is the **"Digital Glass Window"** into that system.
The client shouldn't feel like they are filling out a form; they should feel like they are **commanding a capable platform**.

## 1. The Experience: "Command & Control"
Instead of a standard SaaS dashboard, we build a **Mission Control Center**.

*   **Visual Vibe:** Professional, clean, focused on **Results**.
*   **The "Pulse":** The user should feel the platform is active and working.
    *   *Indicator:* "⚡ Nimmit Team: Active"
    *   *Indicator:* "3 specialists available in Video Pool"

## 2. The Workflow: Intake ➔ Production

### Step 1: The Briefing (AI Intake)
*   **The Interface:** A focused, chat-first interface.
*   **The Persona:** "Nimmit" - Efficient, smart, guides clients from vague ideas to clear specs.
*   **The Interaction:**
    *   *Client:* "I need a hype video for our launch."
    *   *Nimmit:* "Got it. What's the target length? And should I pull your brand assets from last time?" (Institutional Memory)

### Step 2: Smart Routing (Platform Logic)
*   Nimmit AI analyzes the task: category, complexity, required skills.
*   Platform checks worker availability, skills match, and current workload.
*   **Auto-assigns to the best available specialist**—client doesn't choose or see who.
*   *Why:* This enables scale. 10 workers can serve 100+ clients when routing is smart.

### Step 3: Production (The Pool)
*   **Visibility:** The user sees the job status: "In Progress", "Quality Check", "Ready for Review".
*   **Transparency:** Clients see *progress*, not *people*. Nimmit is the brand.
*   **Quality:** Platform ensures consistency regardless of which worker executes.

## 3. Confirmed Design Decisions

1.  **Platform-First:** **Nimmit is the brand.** Clients interact with the platform, not individual workers. Workers are interchangeable—this enables scale.
2.  **Interaction Style:** **Chat-First.** Nimmit AI acts as the conversational partner, guiding the client from a vague idea to a clear spec.
3.  **Smart Routing:** Platform analyzes tasks and auto-assigns based on skills + availability. No client preference for specific workers.
4.  **Scalability:** 10 AI-powered workers → 100+ clients. AI handles 80% of friction; humans focus on execution.
5.  **The Vibe:** Professional, efficient, results-focused. The promise is quality output, not personal relationships.
