# Product Vision: The Digital Command Center

**The Concept:**
If Nimmit is a "System" in the physical world, the App is the **"Digital Glass Window"** into that system.
The client shouldn't feel like they are filling out a form; they should feel like they are **commanding a team**.

## 1. The Experience: "Command & Control"
Instead of a standard SaaS dashboard, we build a **Mission Control Center**.

*   **Visual Vibe:** Professional, clean, focus on **Human Connection**.
*   **The "Pulse":** The user should feel the human presence.
    *   *Indicator:* "🟢 Bora (Editor) is Online"
    *   *Indicator:* "⚡ Nimmit Pool: Active"

## 2. The Workflow: Front Desk ➔ Production Floor

### Step 1: The Briefing Room (AI Intake)
*   **The Interface:** A focused, high-end chat interface (Voice & Text).
*   **The Persona:** "Nimmit" - Efficient, smart, strategic.
*   **The Interaction:**
    *   *Client:* "I need a hype video for our launch."
    *   *Nimmit:* "On it. I see your brand uses 'Cyberpunk' style usually. Is this for the 'Alpha' product launch? I'll pull those assets." (Institutional Memory)

### Step 2: The Handover (Human PM)
*   Once Nimmit clarifies the brief, a **Human PM card** appears.
*   **"Sophea (Senior Playmaker)** is reviewing your strategy... Approved. Routing to Video Pool A."
*   *Why:* This visualizes the "Human in the Loop" safety net. It's the Nimmit Standard.

### Step 3: Production (The Pool)
*   **Visibility:** The user sees the ticket move into the **"Active Floor"**.
*   **Real-Time Status:** "Rendering", "Quality Check", "Final Polish".
*   **Transparency:** They don't pick the specific worker (Nimmit manages that), but they see the *progress*.

## 3. Confirmed Design Decisions (User Feedback)

1.  **Transparency:** **Show the Human.** Clients will see "Bora is editing," not just "Video Pool." This builds the relationship while Nimmit ensures the standard.
2.  **Interaction Style:** **Chat-First (WhatsApp Style).** Nimmit acts as the conversational partner, guiding the client from a vague idea to a clear spec across the chat.
3.  **The Vibe:** **No Building Metaphors.** Keep it abstract. Focus on the *result* and the *person* doing the work, not a map of a factory.
