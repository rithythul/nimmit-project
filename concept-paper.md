# Concept Paper: Cambodia-US On-Demand Work Platform
**Project Codename:** Nimmit
**Prepared:** January 21, 2026
**Review Date:** January 22, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity:** Create an on-demand platform connecting US clients with skilled Cambodian workers for remote work (design, video, development, accounting). The platform combines the quality control of traditional VA services with the speed and flexibility of gig marketplaces, leveraging Cambodia's 12-hour timezone advantage for "overnight delivery."

**Current Assets:** 15 skilled workers across video editing, graphic design, web/mobile development, accounting, and smart contracts.

**Market Position:** Premium-quality, curated talent pool at mid-market pricing ($15-35/hour to clients vs. $8-12/hour to workers), targeting US digital solopreneurs and small agencies with subscription-based model.

**Target:** $15K MRR within 4 months, 50 active clients, path to $50K+ MRR within 12 months.

**Investment Needed:** $15-25K for legal setup, platform development, initial marketing (can bootstrap with manual operations to reduce).

## Business Concept

### The Problem We Solve

**For US Clients:**
- Fiverr/Upwork quality is inconsistent, time-consuming to vet
- Traditional VA services are expensive ($30-75/hour) with slow onboarding
- Hiring full-time is too expensive for small businesses/solopreneurs
- Need reliable, fast, affordable creative and technical support

**For Cambodian Workers:**
- Limited access to US client base
- Race to the bottom on global marketplaces
- No steady work flow
- Undervalued despite strong skills

### Our Solution

**"Overnight Work Service"** - A curated platform where US clients submit work requests that are intelligently matched to skilled Cambodian workers. While US clients sleep, their work gets done.

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Curated quality:** Pre-vetted, trained workers (not open marketplace chaos)
2. **Speed:** AI-powered matching + timezone advantage = same-day/overnight delivery
3. **Simplicity:** Fixed pricing, clear deliverables (not endless hourly uncertainty)
4. **Reliability:** Direct platform relationship, quality guarantees, dispute resolution
5. **Value:** 40-60% cheaper than US alternatives without sacrificing quality

### Positioning Statement

*"Premium Asian talent, overnight delivery, fraction of US cost. Your work gets done while you sleep."*

## Business Model

### Service Offering (Phase 1 - Launch with Core Services)

**Focus on 3 strongest capabilities initially:**

**1. Video Editing**
- Social media content (Reels, TikToks, YouTube)
- Product videos
- Testimonial editing
- Pricing: $79-199/video or $20/hour

**2. Graphic Design**
- Social media posts
- Posters/flyers
- Presentation decks
- Simple branding
- Pricing: $29-99/deliverable or $25/hour

**3. Web Development**
- Landing pages
- WordPress sites
- Web apps
- Maintenance/updates
- Pricing: $299-2,500/project or $35/hour

**Expand to other services (accounting, bookkeeping, smart contracts, mobile apps) after proving core model.**

### Pricing Model: Subscription Tiers (RECOMMENDED)

| Tier | Price | Credits | Delivery | Best For |
|------|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Starter** | $299/mo | 10 credits | 48 hours | Solopreneurs, content creators |
| **Growth** | $699/mo | 25 credits | 24 hours | Small agencies, growing startups |
| **Scale** | $1,499/mo | 60 credits | 12 hours | Agencies, funded startups |

**Credit System:**
- 1 credit = ~$30 value
- Social media post = 1 credit
- Video edit (1-2 min) = 2-3 credits
- Landing page = 10 credits
- Unused credits roll over (up to 2 months)

**Why Subscriptions:**
- Predictable recurring revenue
- Higher customer lifetime value (6-12 month retention vs. 1-3 one-off jobs)
- Encourages regular usage (sunk cost fallacy works in our favor)
- Easier capacity planning
- Lower churn than pay-per-task

**Alternative: Pay-Per-Task (Secondary Option)**
- For clients who want to test or have sporadic needs
- Individual deliverables at fixed prices
- 15% higher pricing than subscription equivalent (incentivize subscription)

### Revenue Share Model

**Option A: 40/60 Split (Recommended for Scale)**
- Platform: 40%
- Worker: 60%
- Simple, transparent, easy to recruit external workers later

**Example:**
- Client pays $299/month (10 credits)
- Worker completes 10 credits worth of work
- Worker earns: $179.40 (60%)
- Platform keeps: $119.60 (40%)
- Less payment processing (3%): $110.63 net

**Option B: Fixed Hourly + Bonus (For Current In-House Team)**
- Workers get $8-12/hour base (based on skill level)
- 5-star ratings earn 20% bonus
- Fast delivery (< half estimated time) earns 10% bonus
- You keep the margin

**Recommendation:** Start with Option B for your 15 people (predictable for them), transition to Option A when recruiting externally.

### Worker Capacity Management

**Current capacity:** 15 workers × 40 hours/week = 600 hours/week = 2,400 hours/month

**Realistic utilization:** 60-70% (to account for gaps, mismatches, downtime) = 1,440-1,680 billable hours/month

**Revenue potential at full capacity:**
- 1,680 hours × $25 average rate = $42,000/month
- At 40% margin = $16,800/month platform revenue
- At 50% utilization (realistic early stage) = $8,400/month

**Scaling trigger:** When >80% utilized for 2+ consecutive weeks, recruit 5 more workers.

### Job Assignment Logic

**AI-Powered Matching Algorithm:**

1. **Request parsing:** Extract required skills, complexity, deadline from client request
2. **Skill scoring:** Match against worker profiles (primary skills, secondary skills, past performance)
3. **Availability filtering:** Remove workers on active jobs or unavailable
4. **Workload balancing:** Prefer workers with fewer active hours
5. **Performance weighting:** Favor workers with >4.7 ratings for important clients
6. **Assignment:** Top 3 candidates notified, first to accept (within 15 min) gets job

**Fallback:** If no acceptance in 30 min, admin manually assigns or contacts client about timeline.

**Concurrent job rules:**
- Small jobs (<2 hours estimated): Can handle 2-3 simultaneously
- Medium jobs (2-8 hours): Maximum 2 concurrent
- Large jobs (>8 hours): Exclusive focus until complete

## Target Market & Customer Acquisition

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Primary: Digital Solopreneurs**
- Revenue: $5K-50K/month (enough to pay, not enough for full-time staff)
- Examples: Coaches, consultants, course creators, content creators, small agency owners
- Pain: Overwhelmed with content, admin, creative work
- Budget: $300-1,000/month
- Acquisition: Social media, content marketing, communities

**Why them:**
- High pain point (they hate the tasks we do)
- Understand value of delegation
- Decision maker = user (no complex sales)
- Recurring needs (not one-off projects)
- Easy to reach online

**Secondary: Small Agencies (5-20 employees)**
- Use case: White-label overflow work
- Budget: $1,000-3,000/month
- Volume: 40-100 hours/month
- Acquisition: Partnerships, LinkedIn outreach

### Go-To-Market Strategy (First 90 Days)

**Phase 1: Founder-Led Sales (Weeks 1-4)**
- Target: 10 customers, $3,000 MRR
- Channel: Direct outreach to network
- Offer: Founding member rate ($149/month for Starter tier - 50% off)
- Goal: Proof of concept, testimonials, learn what converts

**Phase 2: Content + Community (Weeks 5-8)**
- Target: 25 total customers, $7,500 MRR
- Channels:
  - Daily LinkedIn posts (case studies, tips, behind-scenes)
  - Start blog (SEO: "how to hire VA", "video editing services")
  - Free webinar: "How to 10X your content output for $300/month"
  - Join/contribute to entrepreneur communities (Reddit, Facebook groups)
- Goal: Build audience, organic pipeline

**Phase 3: Paid Acquisition Test (Weeks 9-12)**
- Target: 40-50 customers, $12K-15K MRR
- Channels:
  - Facebook/Instagram ads ($1,000/month budget)
  - LinkedIn ads ($500/month)
  - Google Ads (brand + "video editing service" keywords)
- Goal: Validate paid channel, measure CAC
- Target CAC: <$150 (LTV should be $900+ with 6-month retention)

**Phase 4: Scale (Month 4+)**
- Double down on best-performing channel
- Introduce referral program (refer 3 people, get 1 month free)
- Launch partner program (agencies/platforms get 20% commission)
- Expand service offerings (add accounting, mobile dev)

### Marketing Messages to Test

**A) Overnight Angle**
"Submit your video editing request at 5pm. Wake up to it done. That's the Cambodia timezone advantage."

**B) Price/Value Angle**
"Premium video editing for $79. US quality, Asian pricing. No marketplace lottery."

**C) Simplicity Angle**
"Stop hunting on Fiverr. Stop managing freelancers. One platform, curated talent, fixed pricing."

**D) Speed Angle**
"48-hour delivery standard. 24-hour priority. 12-hour rush. Faster than any VA service."

**Test all four across ads, landing pages, track which converts best.**

## Decision Points

**You need to decide:**

1. **Legal structure:** US LLC only, Cambodia entity only, or both? *(Recommend: Both)*

2. **Initial service focus:** Launch with all 15 capabilities or focus on 3 strongest? *(Recommend: Focus on 3)*

3. **Pricing model:** Subscription, pay-per-task, or hybrid? *(Recommend: Subscription primary, pay-per-task secondary)*

4. **Technology approach:** Manual operations (cheap, fast) or build platform (expensive, scalable)? *(Recommend: Manual for first 20 customers, then build)*

5. **Target customer:** Solopreneurs, agencies, or startups? *(Recommend: Solopreneurs first, expand later)*

6. **Worker compensation:** Percentage split or fixed hourly? *(Recommend: Fixed hourly for current team, percentage for future hires)*

7. **Positioning:** Which angle resonates most - overnight delivery, price/value, simplicity, or speed? *(Recommend: Test "overnight delivery" - most unique)*

8. **Investment:** Bootstrap with $5K or raise $20-40K for faster growth? *(Depends on your risk tolerance and timeline)*

## Conclusion & Recommendation

**This is a viable business model.** The unit economics work, there's clear market demand, and you have competitive advantages (timezone, cost structure, curated quality).

**Biggest risks:** Customer acquisition and quality consistency. Both are manageable with the right systems.

**Recommended path forward:**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Legal setup, don't skip this
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Standardize your 3 core services
3. **Weeks 5-8:** Manual launch to 20 customers, prove demand
4. **Weeks 9-12:** Build platform, scale to 50 customers
5. **Month 4-12:** Scale to $50K+ MRR, 120 customers, 45 workers

**Start with $5-10K investment** (legal + initial marketing), bootstrap using manual operations, reinvest early profits into platform development.

**Key insight from deep dive:** Focus on retention over acquisition. A subscription customer who stays 12 months is worth 10x a one-off project customer. Build for recurring relationships, not transactions.

**Next step:** Review this concept paper, make decisions on the 8 decision points above, then move to action plan execution.
