# US Brand & Culture Guide for Remote Workers

**Purpose:** Help Cambodian team members understand US business culture, communication style, and brand expectations to deliver exceptional work for American clients.

---

## 1. US BUSINESS COMMUNICATION STYLE

### **Direct & Results-Oriented**

**US clients expect:**
- ✅ Get to the point quickly (no long intros)
- ✅ Clear status updates without being asked
- ✅ Proactive communication about problems
- ✅ Solutions, not just problems

**Examples:**

❌ **Avoid (Too indirect):**
"Hello Sir, I hope you are doing well. I am writing to inform you that there might be a small issue with the file you sent. If it's okay with you, could you possibly..."

✅ **Better (Direct):**
"Hi [Name], I found an issue with the file - the logo is low resolution. Can you send a higher quality version? I need it by 3pm to stay on schedule."

### **Informal but Professional**

**US business culture is casual:**
- Use first names (not "Sir/Madam" unless they ask)
- Friendly tone is expected
- But still professional (no slang, no overly casual language)

**Examples:**

❌ **Too formal:** "Dear Mr. Johnson, I humbly request..."
❌ **Too casual:** "Hey dude, ur video is done lol"
✅ **Just right:** "Hi Tom, your video is ready for review!"

### **Time Sensitivity**

**Americans value punctuality:**
- Deadlines are firm, not suggestions
- If you'll be late, tell them ASAP (not at deadline)
- Under-promise, over-deliver (say 48 hours, deliver in 36)

**Time zone awareness:**
- When you say "tomorrow," clarify timezone
- Use specific times: "I'll send it by 9am EST" not "tomorrow morning"
- Remember: US is 12-13 hours behind Cambodia

### **"Can-Do" Attitude**

**US clients want:**
- Positive responses to challenges
- Problem-solving mindset
- Confidence (but honest about limitations)

**Examples:**

❌ **Avoid:** "I don't know how to do that"
✅ **Better:** "I haven't done that exact thing before, but I can research it and have a solution by [time]. Or I can connect you with a teammate who specializes in this."

❌ **Avoid:** "That's not possible"
✅ **Better:** "That's challenging with the current timeline, but here are 2 alternatives that could work..."

## 2. US BRAND VOICE & TONE

### **Conversational, Not Corporate**

Most US brands (especially small businesses, startups, coaches) want:
- Friendly, approachable tone
- Like talking to a friend, not a corporation
- Personality over formality

**Social media caption examples:**

❌ **Too corporate:**
"We are pleased to announce the launch of our new product line. We cordially invite you to visit our website."

✅ **US brand style:**
"We've been working on something special 👀 Our new collection just dropped. Link in bio!"

### **Benefit-Focused, Not Feature-Focused**

**US marketing focuses on outcomes:**
- Not "what it is," but "what it does for you"
- Emotional connection over specs

**Examples:**

❌ **Feature-focused:** "Our app has a scheduling feature and calendar sync"
✅ **Benefit-focused:** "Never miss a meeting again. Your calendar, perfectly organized."

### **Authentic & Transparent**

**US brands value:**
- Realness over perfection
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Admitting mistakes
- User-generated content (real customers)

**Instagram post examples:**

❌ **Too polished:** "Our product is perfect for everyone!"
✅ **Authentic:** "Here's what our customers are saying (and yes, we read the critical reviews too 😅)"

### **Action-Oriented (CTAs)**

**Every piece of content should have a next step:**
- "Shop now"
- "Learn more"
- "Tell us in the comments"
- "Tag a friend who needs this"
- "Sign up here"

## 3. VISUAL STYLE PREFERENCES

### **Clean & Minimalist**

**US brands typically prefer:**
- Lots of white space
- Simple, clear fonts

- High-quality images (not clipart)

**Design mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Too much text on images
- ❌ Multiple fonts (stick to 1-2)
- ❌ Low-quality stock photos
- ❌ Excessive effects/shadows/gradients

### **Mobile-First**

**Most Americans view content on phones:**
- Design for vertical/square formats first
- Text must be readable on small screens
- Videos should work without sound (add captions)

### **Platform-Specific Styles**

**Instagram:**
- High-quality, aesthetic photos
- Cohesive grid/feed
- Stories are casual, posts are polished

**TikTok:**
- Authentic, raw, trending
- Jump on trends quickly
- Entertainment > perfection

**LinkedIn:**
- Professional but not stiff

## 7. WORKING WITH US CLIENTS: BEST PRACTICES

### **Communication Cadence**

**Daily updates for active projects:**
- Morning message (your evening): "Starting work on [project]"
- End-of-day message (your morning): "Completed [X], next up is [Y]"
- Flag blockers immediately

**Use async communication well:**
- Loom videos to show progress
- Screenshots with annotations
- Detailed messages (so they don't need to reply with questions)

### **File Delivery**

**Always:**
- ✅ Name files clearly: `ClientName_ProjectName_v1.png`
- ✅ Include multiple formats if needed (JPG + PNG, or PDF + editable)
- ✅ Organize in folders (not loose files)
- ✅ Include a note about what's included

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "untitled.png" or "final_final_v3.jpg"
- ❌ Sending everything in one zip with no structure
- ❌ Assuming they know what each file is for

### **Revision Requests**

**How to handle feedback:**
- Don't take it personally (it's business)
- Clarify if unclear: "Just to confirm, you want the logo bigger and moved to the left?"
- Provide options when possible: "I can do A or B - which do you prefer?"
- If it's out of scope: "I can definitely do that. It would be an additional [X] hours. Should I proceed?"

### **Quality Standards**

**Before delivering any work:**
- ✅ Spellcheck everything (US spelling: "color" not "colour")
- ✅ Check links work
- ✅ Review on mobile if it's digital content
- ✅ Follow the client's brand guidelines
- ✅ Match the quality of their previous content (or better)

### **When You Don't Know Something**

**It's okay to not know - just handle it right:**

❌ **Don't:** Guess or deliver subpar work
✅ **Do:** "I want to make sure I get this right. Can you clarify [X]?" or "I haven't worked with this tool before. Give me 24 hours to learn it, or I can connect you with a teammate who specializes in it."

## 8. LANGUAGE & WRITING TIPS

### **US English Spelling**

- Color (not colour)
- Realize (not realise)
- Center (not centre)
- License (not licence)
- Organization (not organisation)

### **Common US Business Phrases**

- "Circle back" = follow up later
- "Touch base" = check in / communicate
- "Loop in" = include someone in conversation
- "Bandwidth" = time/capacity
- "In the weeds" = too detailed / stuck on minor issues
- "Low-hanging fruit" = easy wins
- "Move the needle" = make significant progress
- "At the end of the day" = ultimately / what matters most

### **Writing for Social Media**

**Good practices:**
- Short sentences
- Paragraph breaks (white space)
- Emojis are encouraged (but don't overdo it)
- Ask questions to encourage engagement
- Use "you" language (talk to the reader directly)

**Caption structure that works:**

```
Hook (grab attention in first line)
↓
Context/story (2-4 sentences)
↓
Value/lesson (what can they learn?)
↓
Call to action (what should they do next?)
↓
Hashtags (if relevant)
```

### **Avoid These Common Non-Native Speaker Patterns**

❌ "Kindly do the needful" → ✅ "Could you please [specific action]?"
❌ "Please revert back" → ✅ "Please reply" or "Let me know"
❌ "Do the necessary" → ✅ "Complete this" or "Take care of this"
❌ "Myself [Name]" → ✅ "I'm [Name]" or "This is [Name]"
❌ "I am having" → ✅ "I have"
